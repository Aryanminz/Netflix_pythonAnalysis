# Netflix_pythonAnalysis
Analyzing Netflix Data with Python
Overview
This project delves into the analysis of Netflix data using Python programming. The primary objective is to extract insights, trends, and patterns from the dataset. The analysis process integrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques along with data visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Dataset
The dataset utilized in this analysis consists of Netflix content information, including titles, genres, release years, and more.
About the data set
TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

Inspiration
Some of the interesting questions (tasks) which can be performed on this dataset -

Understanding what content is available in different countries
Identifying similar content by matching text-based features
Network analysis of Actors / Directors and find interesting insights
Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
